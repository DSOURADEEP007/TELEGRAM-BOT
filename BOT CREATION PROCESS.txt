THE FIRST STEP U MUST DO IS CREATE A BOT OF YOUR OWN THROUGH THE BOTFATHER THAT IS PRE AVAILABLE IN TELEGRAM
FOLLOW THE FOLLOWING STEPS:

* OPEN THE BOTFATHER BOT IN TELEGRAM
* GIVE THE COMMAND "/start". IT WILL LIST ALL THE FUNCTIONS IT CAN PERFORM
* FROM THE AVAILABLE FUNCTION GIVE THE COMMAND "/newbot" TO CREATE A NEW BOT OF YOUR OWN
* IT WILL ASK FOR A NAME FOR YOUR BOT. GIVE IT A NAME, IN MY CASE ITS Bot@2114
* FOLLOWING THIS STEP THE BOTFATHER WILL ASK OF YOU TO PROVIDE A UNIQUE USERNAME FOR THE BOT.
  HERE IN MY CASE ITS "URLSDbot"
  (KEEP IN MIND THAT THE USERNAME OF YOUR BOT MUST END WITH "bot")
* YOUR BOT IS CREATED AFTER THIS STEP AND YOU ARE PROVIDED WITH A UNIQUE HTTP API
